          <h2>
            Hello there! I'm Harsh Moye, and I'm excited to have you here. Let
            me give you a glimpse into who I am and what I'm all about.
          </h2>
          <p>
            First off, I've always been a curious soul, fascinated by how things
            work. Whether it's dissecting gadgets or diving into the world of
            coding, I thrive on understanding the nuts and bolts of everything
            around me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coding has become my creative outlet. There's something magical
            about turning lines of code into digital realities, and I love every
            minute of it. But my interests don't stop thereâ€”I'm also passionate
            about design and the power it holds to transform experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            And beyond that, I'm also deeply passionate about acting, dancing,
            and playing sports like cricket, football, volleyball, and
            badminton. Whether it's rehearsing for a play or hitting the field,
            I love exploring different forms of expression and staying active.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, whether you're here to collaborate or just share a virtual
            high-five, I'm excited to connect and dive into our shared
            interests!
